### SurveyQuiz

[SurveyQuiz](https://surveyquiz.dk/) was an attempt to build a new form of survey software that gave the respondent immediate, interesting and useful feedback when answering survey questions. The ideas was born after working for four years in a small consultancy firm where we conducted a large number of surveys.

### Skovskolen

The Skovskolen app was built together with design students at the IT University of Copenhagen. It was an app built with React Native. The purpose was to make an app that could be used when walking a certain route in, say, a national park. It would tell you how far you were from a certain point. And when you came within a certain distance of an interesting object, it would tell you some useful information about that point of interest.
